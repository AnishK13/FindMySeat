Vision and Goal:
To design a smart web application that minimizes the time students waste looking for vacant seats in the college reading hall. The system allows students to view the real-time layout of available seats and book them for a desired duration (up to 12 hours), ensuring efficient utilization of space and time.

Working:
-When a student enters the reading hall, they open the web app on their device.
-The application displays a visual layout of the reading hall with real-time seat availability.
-The student selects any unoccupied seat and books it for a specified duration (maximum of 12 hours).
-Upon expiration, the booking ends automatically. The student can rebook the same or another seat if needed.
-Seat availability is continuously updated to reflect bookings and expirations.

Key Features:
-Secure Login with College Email
 Only authenticated users with college email addresses (e.g., c2k221316@ms.pict.edu) can register and access the system. This prevents unauthorized access.

-Geolocation-Based Access Control
 Students can only book seats when physically present inside the reading hall. The system uses the browser’s Geolocation API to verify the user's location relative to the hall’s coordinates.

-Interactive Hall Layout
 A visual representation of the reading hall (grid-based or mapped layout) allows users to choose their preferred seat with a single click. (image of my reading hall is attached)

-Time-Bound Booking
 Users can book a seat for any duration up to 6 hours. After the selected period, the seat is automatically marked as available.

-Single Active Booking Enforcement
 A student can hold only one active booking at a time to ensure fair access for everyone.

-Early cancellation
 If student wishes to leave early, student can cancel the booking before actual duration
